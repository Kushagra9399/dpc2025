'''
You are given a string s. Your task is to find and return the longest palindromic substring within the given string. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
Input:
A string s of length n. The length of the string satisfies 1â‰¤nâ‰¤1000.
Output:
Return the longest substring of s that is a palindrome. If there are multiple solutions, return the first one that occurs.
Examples:
Example 1
Input: "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: Both "bab" and "aba" are palindromic substrings, but since "bab" appears first in the string, it is returned.
